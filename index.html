                    <li>Don’t panic. Are you easily prone to stress? Read about 3 Ways To Stay Calm During An Emergency</li>

                    <li>Make sure you are in a safe position to offer help. DO NOT attempt to assist victims if you are in danger (for example, the <br> building is on fire, traffic has not been controlled, or guns are being fired etc.). </li>
                    <li>Remember the ABCs of Life Support Airways open—Open and maintain victim’s airway. Breathing restored—If victim is not <br>  breathing, then begin rescue-breathing techniques immediately. Circulation maintained—If no pulse is present, call 911 or your <br> local Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and then get assistance from a person certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation <br> (CPR) techniques. REMEMBER, to be able to perform CPR effectively, it is essential to be properly trained.</li>
                    <li>Check for bleeding. Apply direct pressure with a clean cloth and seek medical attention as soon as possible. If possible, wear <br> health care gloves to protect yourself from direct contact with blood. </li>
                    <li>Look for signs of shock and broken bones or fractures. </li>
                    <li>Call 911 or your local emergency services quickly. Know emergency numbers such as 0 or 911. Telephone appropriate <br> authorities (rescue squad, ambulance, police, poison control center
                        [1-800-222-1222] or fire department) and describe the <br> problem. Be sure to give your name, location, and the number of people involved.</li>
                     <li>Check for emergency medical identification on the victim.</li>
                     <li>Loosen any clothing that may restrict victim’s breathing or interfere with circulation.</li>
                    <li>Never give an unconscious person anything by mouth</li>
                     <li>DO NOT move injured persons unless situation is life threatening. Keep victim still, quiet, and warm (except for heat <br> exhaustion and heatstroke see Heat Exposure section for specific care instructions).
